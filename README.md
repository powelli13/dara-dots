Using Phaser 3 to implement a game idea I have.

Below is an evolving description of the game and rules:

The Board:
The game is played on a board that contains nodes and links. 
The nodes are arranged in a five by five square formation
with equal spacing between nodes. Each node has links connecting
it to the other nodes. The space in between links is a square.
The five nodes closest to each player is their Home Row.
All pieces reside on nodes and move along links except
the circle which resides in squares and moves across links.
A node is open when no pieces are currently placed on it.
A square is open when no pieces are currently in it.

The Actions:
Each turn a player has four action points.

Action points may be used for the following:
    - Move the star, triangle or square along a link
        to the next open node.
    - Move the star or triangle along a link onto
        an adjacent node that has the friendly square,
        then off the square onto an adjacent open node.
    - Move the triangle along a link to a node containing the 
        opposing sides star and capture the star.
    - Move the circle over a link into an adjacent open square.

The Pieces:

The star resides on nodes and moves along links.
